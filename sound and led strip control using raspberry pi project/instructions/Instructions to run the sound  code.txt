hi, so
first thing you need to do is paste the rpi-ws281x-python folder into the pi folder
after that paste the sound_led_test.py script on desktop and run the code 
connect the buttons and the led according to the schematic and speaker is connected to the 3.5mm jack on the pi

also paste a sound file on desktop and copy its path and paste in play sound function

thanks!
